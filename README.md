# Yahtzee Game

This a yahtzee game project that is currently a work in progress. If you'd like to play a live version of the game you can do that here. It's currently set for two player mode so either play against yourself or with a friend.

Might have some plans in the future to build a computer opponent either scripted or even AI.

To run the application on your machine clone the repo, install node modules and run `npm run dev`.
